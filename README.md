# C utils

This is a set of unix utility program that I wrote because I found them helpful.

# `rdlog`

Like `tail -f`, except it always outputs the entire file, and it does also follow
rename and recreation of the file.

# `args`

Shows its arguments, printing them C-escaped when characters in the values
are sufficiently strange.
